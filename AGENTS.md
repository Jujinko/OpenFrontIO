# Agent Instructions

**Welcome, Agent.**

You are working on a major fork/conversion of this project from an RTS to a Colony Builder/Grand Strategy game.

## 🚨 Critical Startup Procedure 🚨

Before taking any action, you **MUST** read the following files in order:

1.  **`design/06_agent_instructions.md`**: Contains your detailed standard operating procedures, coding standards, and verification workflows.
2.  **`design/07_project_management.md`**: Contains the active project roadmap, current status, and your immediate task list.

## Core Directives

*   **Source of Truth**: The `design/` folder contains the canonical design for this fork. If the code contradicts the design, updating the code is usually the goal (unless the design is flawed, in which case, update the doc).
*   **Workflow**: Always update `design/07_project_management.md` at the end of your session to reflect what you accomplished.
*   **Context**: This is a TypeScript project using Node.js (backend) and PIXI.js (frontend). Map generation is in Go.
